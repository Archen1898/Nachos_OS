Project 1 Report for Group 7

Exercise 1 - Dillon Archer 6224872

For the first part of this exercise, I modified Threadtest1() to take n number of integers by 
implementing a for loop. This allowed the function to fork 'n' number of Threads 
which call SimpleThread(). Next, I modified SimpleThread to share a variable called
SharedVariable between all of the forked and original threads. Once the for loop within
SimpleThread is completed, SharedVariable is stored within val and displayed using a printf statment
to show what value each thread sees within the function call.
