I first attempted to get Nachos set up using Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL). The main issue with using WSL was that it needed to update all the packages and set the environment to the correct path. But the issue that made me switch to wolf.cs.fiu.edu was the lack of libraries not being where they are expected to be on WSL. On the wolf server, everything ran well and was quick to be set up. What I ended up doing was that I used Window's OpenSSH client to work with the nachos file as needed.
The tests ran well and were quick to process. The threads demo resulted in the expected output and had 130 system ticks in total. The user program halt contained mainly the halt system command and it brought the current process to exit. Using the single step mode, I was able to see how the simple program were not calling much but it iterated through 12 additional ticks so I could see how the program changed through each step.
The thread class in Nachos is the main command unit of the thread demo. It contained the commands to make the threads run, make the threads yield processing power to other threads, putting the threads to sleep, sending the completed signal when a thread was done executing, checking if the stack overflowed, and outputting a status. It also had segments divided between private and public settings, showing the value of security to the programmer behind the class.
